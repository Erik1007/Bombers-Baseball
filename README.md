**Stockholm Bombers Baseball** webpage is a site designed to welcome people of all skill levels around the area of Stockholm Sweden that want to play adult baseball in a relaxed and fun atmosphere. The site intends to target people that want to build/expand their social network, meet new people and have fun playing ‘America’s Past time’ with like minded people. 

The Stockholm Bombers are a long established adult baseball team, with a rich history that includes athletes of all levels and abilities (from lifelong players to first timers) from all around the world that just love the game and want to have fun. The site hopes to introduce the team, provide practice schedule, game schedule, team pics and a sign-up form. 

**The webite color scheme:** The Stockholm Bombers Team Colors are White, Forest green and Red. Therefor I have been working on maintaining and representing the team colors as much as possible through the website.

**Features:**

This website consists of four pages that provide information about the team, motivate joining the team and provide multiple ways to contact the team leaders. The site is designed for a visitor to be able to easily navigate from page to page with consitent links and color schemes to be able to find information about the team, where the team plays, an accurate schedule of when the team plays, a gallery of pics showing the team having fun and lastly a means to contact the team and coaches if the visitor wants to play.


**Existing Features:**

-**Navigation bar**

Featured on all four pages there is a consistent and full responsive set of links for the home page, the schedule page, the gallery page and the contact page.

The 'navigation bar' wll allow the visitor to move back and forth through the pages without having to use the back arrows on the page.

-**About us Section:** 

The 'about us' section aims to provide a quick overview of some of the benefits and draws for people and players to join the team. This section highlights a few of the reasons why playing baseball with the Bombers is fun, beneficial and a great choice.

-**The 'Find Us' section:**

There is a map with a laid out plan for a person to travel from the metro station to the field and where the field is located in Stockholm. There are two links: one to the swedish transportion webpage for commuters and the second is to Google maps so that a visitor can find their own directions to the field.

-**Footer:**

The footer section is consistent on every page and contains four links. Two of the icons represen links to our social netwrok site. The third link is to the club to which we belong that represents the other teams in the club. The last link connects to the Swedish baseball federation that has the team roster, schedule, results and statistics.

-**The Schedule page:**

This area is designed to inciteful and inviting by providing dates, times and location for all of the team events for the rest of the season.

There are images of the remaining 3 months of the baseball season presented horizontally under the header. Those images contain different color circles that corespond to the information provided directly below the calanders. The teams practice are represented with red circles and drop-in open practices are shown with blue circles. In the middle there is a green table that shows all the information concerning the remaining games of the season that correspond to the green circles on the calander.

**Future features to include and implement:**

1. In the future I would like to add a “timed slide show effect” to the hero image section to create a rotating background image set for the hero image section of the landing page.

2. I would like to include an interactive schedule with a scroll bar that has highlighted days for the games that link to the Swedish baseball game results page.

3. I have the idea to create a page with links to a few vendors that the players use to buy gloves, bats and other miscellaneous items. With listings and recommendations for appropriate gear.

4. I would also like to set up an online store where Bomber shirts, hats and stickers that I have designed and created can be purchased/ordered.

5. I would also like to create a member section of the webpage that has a messaging service and an events calendar for members to sign up to team events (similar to what we have now in Facebook, but without being on Facebook).


**Testing:**

Using https://validator.w3.org/, each page was tested repeatedly to track and debug errors in the code, until all errors were eliminated in all pages of the code.
