Stockholm Bombers Baseball webpage is a site to welcome people of all skill levels in Stockholm Sweden that want to play adult baseball in a relaxed and fun atmosphere. The site intends to target people that want to build/expand their social network, meet new people and have fun playing ‘America’s Past time’ with like minded people. 

The Stockholm Bombers are an established adult baseball team that has players of all levels and abilities (from lifelong players to first timers) from all around the world that just love the game and want to have fun. The site hopes to introduce the team, provide practice schedule, game schedule, team pics and a sign-up form. 

The webite color scheme: The Stockholm Bombers Team Colors are White, Forest green and Red. Therefor I have been working on maintaining and representing the team colors as much as possible through the website.

Features:

This website consists of four pages for now. The site is designed for a visitor to be able to easily navigate from page to page with consitent links and color schemes to be able to find information about the team, where the team plays, an accurate schedule of when the team plays, a gallery of pics showing the team having fun and lastly a means to contact the team and coaches if the visitor want to play.

Existing Features:

Navigation bar

Featured on all four pages there is a consistent and full responsie set of links for the home page, the schedule page, the gallery page and the contact page.

The 'navigation bar' wll allow the visitor to move back and forth through the pages without having to use the back arrows on the page.

The 'Find Us' section:

There is a map with a laid out plan for a person to travel from the metro station to the field and where the field is located in Stockholm. There are two links: one to the swedish transportion webpage for commuters and the second is to Google maps so that a visitor can find their own directions to the field.

Footer:

The footer section is consistent on every page and contains four links. Two of the icons represen links to our social netwrok site. The third link is to the club to which we belong that represents the other teams in the club. The last link connects to the Swedish baseball federation that has the team roster, schedule, results and statistics.

On this page a visitor will see a collage of the Bombers team members playing baseball, and having fun. The goal of this page is to show that the team is focused on having a good time while playing the game. This page will provide value to the user though representing inclusion, diversity and fun.

The Contact page:

This page provides the user a means to sign up to join a practice and a means to contact the team and its coaches. 

The form on the left hand side has contact information and buttons to provide a little background information on the player that wants to join the team. 

On the lower right hand side there are email links for the baseball team and the two coaches that run the team.

Future features to include and implement:

1.In the future I would like to add a “timed slide show effect” to the hero image section to create a rotating background image set for the hero image section of the landing page.

2.I would like to include an interactive schedule with a scroll bar that has highlighted days for the games that link to the Swedish baseball game results page.

3.I have the idea to create a page with links to a few vendors that the players use to buy gloves, bats and other miscellaneous items. With listings and recommendations for appropriate gear.

4.I would also like to set up an online store where Bomber shirts, hats and stickers that I have designed and created can be purchased/ordered.

5.I would also like to create a member section of the webpage that has a messaging service and an events calendar for members to sign up to team events (similar to what we have now in Facebook, but without being on Facebook).
